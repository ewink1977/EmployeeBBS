                        Messages are segregated to departments, so
                        it is as if each department has their own

                        department can prioritize messages so they
                        remain at the top of the message timeline,
                        and site-wide supervisors can send messages
                        to any department as well as pin sitewide
                        messages to the top of the timeline!</p>

                        be displayed for a single department or the
                        entire site! Sometimes your users do not
                        need to know about an event or project
                        happening in another department, so no need
